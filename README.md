# Flexbox Site Project

This is a project that involves making a homepage site using only flexbox. I was given the option to use an imaginary company, real company or person to make a portfolio for or site. I chose to make a site for a real business.

These are the minimum requirements I had, beyond that I had the option to get creative

1. A title and logo or splash image
2. A mission statement or brief description of the company.
3. A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.
4. A section describing some of the companyâ€™s employees or teammates.
